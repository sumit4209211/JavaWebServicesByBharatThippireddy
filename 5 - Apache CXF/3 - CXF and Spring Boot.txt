CXF and Spring Boot :

1) Apache CXF makes it super easy to create web service applications by supporting the use of spring boot.

2) Once we start using the support of spring boot to come up with cxf applications we simply add a cxf spring dependency a maven dependency one doing single jar file to our pom dot xml this can be done right.


3) When we create a project in spring tools suit IDE the dependency is cxf hyphen spring hyphen starter hyphen jaxrs.

4) Once we add this dependency automatically all the other jar files that are required to build RESTful services or soap services will be transitively dragged in so you simply create a project add a single dependency and we'll get all the dependencies for free thanks to springboot start starter projects.


5) Secondly it also makes the publishing of our restful endpoint very easy.You simply add a property called cxf dot JAXRS dot components scan is equal to true.

6) Once you do that in the application dot properties which is the spring boot properties file automatically all your web services end points will be discovered and published.It's that powerful.

7) There is no need for any cxf hyphen servlet dot XML or java configuration so you simply create a project and add this line to your application dot properties once you come up with your Java classes and you are done.

8) Additionally you can add properties to these application dot properties such as server dot context hyphen path.

9) Using this you can define a web application context for your restful or soap application.

10) So in the next few lectures you will be creating apache cxf spring boot project and configuring these properties.
