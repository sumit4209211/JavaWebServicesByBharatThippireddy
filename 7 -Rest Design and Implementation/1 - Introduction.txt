Introduction:

1) You will start this section by learning the four simple steps that are required to design RESTful web services.

2) You will then move on to implement the RESTful services by learning what JAX-RS is and the important annotations in the JAX-RS API. You'll implement a Patient Management RESTful web service which supports both XML and well as JSON requests and responses.

3) You'll also learn how to test your RESTful web services using the easy to use REST plugin that is available for the Chrome web browser.

4) You will end it by learning how to implement RESTful clients, web service clients for your applications both in Java using JAX-RS as well as JavaScript which can be used in your applications.
